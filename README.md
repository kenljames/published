# The Primary Human Urges

Note: The following respresents my personal best understanding of the fundamental system which is responsible for the clearly varying yet, finite, procedured development of the human will.

## A Primal Urgency

Perhaps one of the most interesting facts of science to me, which is at the sametime is widely misunderstood, is that science hasn't given a the slightest hint as to why anything exists or happens.

Most of our understanding of the physical universe is built upon the law of inertia. Which usefully describes the universe as we are currently experiencing it, in a state of flux if you will. 

> *How do we know the universe is in a state of flux?*
You can tell it's a state of flux by the few attributes of the known univers as a whole which we've been able to measure. Particularly the fact that the universe is expanding and slowing at a predictable rate suggests that the universe is following a procedure which ultimately will end with the expulsion of all kinetic energy in the universe, thereby at the same time making the energy potential for the known universe 100%

This state of flux suggests that the universe is carrying out a set of steps that we are of little significance of, and to. From this context one can grasp the truely probable yet finite beauty of their own existence and life.

From this context I've come to recognize 4 urges universally present, although to varying degrees and impact, in all human beings and likely all intelligent life on earth.

### The 4 Urges
1. the urge to create
2. the urge to connect
3. the urge to experience
4. the urge to survive

> The ideas of urge and chaos being terms used to describe the potentially divine propelers of the universe are not exactly new ones. The term demiurge has been used in english for the greater part 400 years I believe to describe divine potential in a way that was more grounded in the physical reality their minds had become awakened to.

## Deriving A Purpose From Our Urges
To get straight to the pragmatic use of the model in my life (I'll come back and give more strength to the conceps arguments later), I've found that within each of the 4 primal urges there's the potential for a lot of variance in results.

So I spent a great deal of time studying the artifacts left from the lives of men and women whose lived inspiring lives and what I found is that there is a fairly straightforward process one can follow for living purposefully based on their human urges, which at least maximizes to some extent both the likelihood of positive progress.

The system is as follows:

1. If the urge you feel the most constently throughout your life is THE URGE TO CREATE, then you strive TO SERVICE.
2. If the urge you feel the most constently throughout your life is THE URGE TO CONNECT, then you strive TO HUMANIZE.
3. If the urge you feel the most constently throughout your life is THE URGE TO EXPERIENCE, then you strive TO SAVE.
4. If the urge you feel the most constently throughout your life is THE URGE TO SURVIVE, then you strive TO MASTER.





# The First Step

Probably the longest definable and visible affect of my overwhelming anxiety has been my inability to express myself publicly.

If you're in my circle you've probably heard me mention starting a youtube channel, or writing a book, or something similar at least once over the past 5 years. Many people have heard such talk on a nearly weekly basis for the better part of 3 years now... So what gives?

I mean yeah... I'm not known for my reliability. Thanks to Ray Dalio, the top 500 fortune companies probably also know about my less than stellar reliability lol. (lets be clear Ray's reliability isn't any better than mine)

But that's a tangent and a distraction from the real issue. Why the fuck am I so afraid of publishing my thoughts? I'm not afraid of sharing them in person. That much is certain.

The only explanation I really have is *anxiety*. And that emphasis isn't to down play the diagnosis because I know it's accurate, but it's just not useful information. Like I hear people say they just got diagnosed with anxiety and I imagine that means they just learned what the term *anxiety* means because it's a symptom not a fucking diagnosis... What the hell is causing me to feel this anxiety?

I have zero problem saying, loudly and openly, that I am the greatest danger to the status quo on this planet alive.

So why can't I commit to a start? I don't know. I just know it's anxiety and the source is trying to keep from expressing myself.

But hang in there because I've finally picked a battle I can win. My subconsious may be strongest enough to keep me from committing to a youtube channel right this second. But a plain text based blog, with no SEO on a domain I've had parked for years with not even a social media account forward... yeah that's the battlefield I'll die or dominate on.

Given a reasonable amount of time I can't communicate who I am here then I'm not who I think I am anyways.
