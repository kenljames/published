# The First Step

Probably the longest definable and visible affect of my overwhelming anxiety has been my inability to express myself publicly.

If you're in my circle you've probably heard me mention starting a youtube channel, or writing a book, or something similar at least once over the past 5 years. Many people have heard such talk on a nearly weekly basis for the better part of 3 years now... So what gives?

I mean yeah... I'm not known for my reliability. Thanks to Ray Dalio, the top 500 fortune companies probably also know about my less than stellar reliability lol. (lets be clear Ray's reliability isn't any better than mine)

But that's a tangent and a distraction from the real issue. Why the fuck am I so afraid of publishing my thoughts? I'm not afraid of sharing them in person. That much is certain.

The only explanation I really have is *anxiety*. And that emphasis isn't to down play the diagnosis because I know it's accurate, but it's just not useful information. Like I hear people say they just got diagnosed with anxiety and I imagine that means they just learned what the term *anxiety* means because it's a symptom not a fucking diagnosis... What the hell is causing me to feel this anxiety?

I have zero problem saying, loudly and openly, that I am the greatest danger to the status quo on this planet alive.

So why can't I commit to a start? I don't know. I just know it's anxiety and the source is trying to keep from expressing myself.

But hang in there because I've finally picked a battle I can win. My subconsious may be strongest enough to keep me from committing to a youtube channel right this second. But a plain text based blog, with no SEO on a domain I've had parked for years with not even a social media account forward... yeah that's the battlefield I'll die or dominate on.

Given a reasonable amount of time I can't communicate who I am here then I'm not who I think I am anyways.
